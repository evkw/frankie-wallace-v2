        Hi, I’m Frankie
      </h2>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 font-body mb-6">
        A watercolour artist and surface pattern designer based in Sydney,
        Australia, creating nostalgic, hand-painted designs for children’s
        brands and beyond.
      </p>
      <p class="text-base text-gray-600 font-body mb-6">
        If you’re looking for art that feels hand-painted and heartfelt, I’d
        love to collaborate.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base text-gray-600 font-body mb-6">
        I license my surface-pattern collections for apparel, textiles, and
        homewares, and also take on a small number of bespoke illustration
        commissions each year — from packaging and branding artwork to venue
        paintings and custom keepsakes.
      </p>

      <p class="text-base text-gray-600 font-body">
        Each piece begins in traditional watercolour and is delivered digitally,
        ready for print or production.
