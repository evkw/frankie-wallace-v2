# 🌿 Letters From the Studio  
## Why I Paint in Watercolour: Finding Calm, Storytelling, and Nostalgia in a Digital World

Long before I became a **watercolour surface pattern designer**, watercolour was simply a lifeline. I first picked up a paintbrush in an art therapy session during a season when life felt particularly overwhelming. 

Even now, as the creative world becomes increasingly digital, I keep turning back to my jars of water and my brushes.

The soft textures, the unpredictable edges, the tiny quirks in the paint are special because they can’t be replicated digitally. They remind me of vintage children’s books, favourite fabrics, and storybook moments that inspired my earliest **watercolour illustration** work.

## 🌼 Painting With Purpose

Every collection I create begins the same way: a moodboard, a handful of colours, and a page of loose sketches that slowly become a story. Whether I’m painting bunnies, hedgehogs, soft florals, or little nature adventures, there is always a narrative.

My collections — like **The Little Burrow Garden**, **Garden Reverie**, **Summer Meadow**, and **Home For Christmas** — are built around a sense of **vintage-inspired childhood wonder**. Brands often tell me they choose my work because it feels gentle, nostalgic, and truly handmade.

Watercolour slows me down enough to listen; to my children, to the garden, to the little details of childhood that make life feel soft again.

## 🌸 Why I Choose Hand-Painted Artwork in a Digital Era

The truth is, I love digital tools, but there’s something irreplaceable about the way watercolour behaves.

Watercolour surprises me.  
It teaches me to let go of perfection.  
It makes every bunny, every blossom, every tiny seed pod feel alive.

And in a world full of screens, I think the human touch matters more than ever.

My **hand-painted children’s prints** carry a softness and sincerity that boutique **children’s clothing brands**, babywear designers, and small businesses are increasingly searching for:

- warmth  
- nostalgia  
- story  
- gentle character  
- the unmistakable texture of real paint  

This is why I continue to work traditionally: because I want my work to feel like something you can hold, remember, and pass down.
